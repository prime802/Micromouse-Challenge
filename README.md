# MICROMOUSE

## Introduction
MICROMOUSE is an autonomous robot designed for the International Micromouse Challenge 2022 at IIT Bombay. The challenge involves building a robot capable of rapidly navigating a labyrinth to reach the center in the shortest time possible.

### Project Highlights
- **Techfest, IIT Bombay**
- **Team Size:** 4
- **Duration:** Oct 2022 - Dec 2022


## Overview
Designed and built an autonomous bot with 18cm square cells set over a 16 x 16 grid, achieving the least traversal time to the goal in the maze-solving challenge.

## Technical Details
- Fabricated a custom PCB to boost the bot's performance through integrated electronics.
- Incorporated six sharp infrared (IR) sensors for superior data accuracy during maze exploration.
- Executed maze-solving algorithms, such as flood fill and wall-following, to determine the quickest and most efficient route to the maze's center.
- Implemented PID control for precise and smooth movement, optimizing the robot's path-finding capabilities.

## Code Overview
The project utilizes Arduino Nano and two tires for a compact and speedy design. Given is a snippet of the Arduino IDE code used:
